This is because I feel like some of my answers might seem odd but I have a reason behind them - e.g. asking someone how they do their laundry to me is very personal as it has the potential to reveal their economic situation which I feel can be very personal. So getting a chance to write down rationale I believe would provide valuable qualitative data for the researchers. "}

What do you like or not like about them?,"I enjoy staying in hotels when I'm traveling alone. I feel safe surrounded by people, and it is nice to have someone clean and do the laundry for me.

However, I think I am very much the same person--just a little more mature and with more life experiences. I have overall gotten more liberal politically over the last couple of decades, so my self from 20 years ago, might view this as a little bit of a shock.",148099,1244166

They had these amazing visuals playing behind them, all swirling colors and dreamy landscapes that perfectly matched their music.

What do you like or not like about them?,"Yes I do enjoy staying in hotels. When I first started at my current employer I had to go away on a 3 month training course and stay in hotels. I like that my room would be made up with fresh towels every day, because breakfast and dinner was provided it also allowed me to focus on work, but to also have lots of free time or the gym etc. What I don't like about hotels is the unpredictability of the room quality",120957,1443381

If we are talking about physical fundamentals - most of these things are changeable via plastic surgery/some other form of alteration, e.g. eye colour, body shape/size, weight, and so on.  In terms of personality, I think it is possible for people to change their perspectives and have their eyes opened as it were. Whether it is within the gift of everyone to change fundamental things about themselves I am less sure about. Sometimes close minded people become open minded because of external factors - e.g. a homophobic father might change his ways if he discovers his son is homosexual, a change that might not have otherwise happened.

There has only been 2 times when I got the feeling it wasn't a great idea (the worry of bed bugs and other domino-effect concerns..), out of around 10 times/10 hotels/motels in total. It was actually a moment to relax and not have to worry too much about things. It was a break from ""life"" as we know it, which is full of pressure's, stress, tension, un-ease! I like the fact that they usually contribute almost entirely to that ""vacation"" we mentally enter! What I do not like about them is sometimes there's things we see or hear, whether outside our room or entering/exiting, that may make the stay sketchy! Always the cheaper motels/hotels will have something that way (out of so many various things we will see, or sometimes hear..). One thing I did NOT like about them is that when I am in a hotel/motel, I do NOT want to be bothered at all! If I need sheets or towels, I will get them myself! Hard not to appreciate them knocking and checking, however the hotel/motel stays I have taken have ALWAYS been a mental break from life, in so many pretty crappy ways through my own life! Most recently, I have been thinking how great it would be to be able to book a hotel for a few weeks to just get away from our current 'crappy' situation...

I thought it was a new experience, one which I needed, to get moving forward in our lives, since we were away from a pretty troublesome environment. I figured that we had the normalcy necessary to live a normal life! It only took a single month to learn that not only was I wrong, but now I am going to carry a heavy burden, AGAIN, and am have to going to try to maintain myself as a model that my daughter needs, knowing damn well nothing at our hands for any relief will favor our situation that will actually omit the details that are flat out wrong from happening anymore! The major turning point is that what little faith I had in the system that is there for THIS has been almost entirely diminished, and I have practically no respect at all for it. It sometimes goes up, sometimes goes down, but ultimately, the turning point is that when, and if, you as a person happen to need help that requires another human being, and if your are not versed in social norms (or are just awkward or whatever...), you will continue to struggle until a burst of luck happens to come your way so that you can dig yourself out of a deep hole that only happened from you working VERY hard in various ways to do what you are supposed to do There's a few turning points here, actually, but the main one is how I am watching our criminal system favor someone taking advantage and that it happens to be the stronger weight, over my daughter being safe and feeling safe in HER home! So, someone who has done this through life repeatedly just doing it against us in our home again, versus the legal system not putting their foot down for a full year to get this house sane! Multiple turning points here, but my view of this system may be the biggest. I am going to try resolving this again today, so it is fresh in my mind after last night's noises.",689506,1652280

My past self was super-man, do anything I set my mind too with enough dedication and efforts! Hard work NEVER came to my mind other than when I wondered why some people failed at their own goals. But currently, right now, self-neglect has taken a significant toll on me and my own life experiences have completely eliminated my faith in exterior sources already (a good example is injury attorneys-they are supposed to help and supposed to do what is right.....1 example of so many leading to this very day). My past self was aware of many things, but now that I am deep in the middle of it, witnessing this exact scenario, I now only believe that when someone sets their own deceptive goal, it will most likely outweigh the expectation that the 'right thing' will come in the end.

I have always had trouble dealing with people, and although respectful, considerate, and distant personally, I have still struggled and never quite fit in and have never really had a friendship that I could have relied on for that (there is 1 guy I have learned is the only human being out of so many ""friends"" I would call that..). I would prefer to just be with my daughter and nobody else.. I no longer seek companionship.

Fans sang along to every word as they performed live, giving their music even more substance. Their music has changed so much since I last saw them that it seemed unique. The audience was totally engrossed in the combination of new hits and old favorites on the set list. I will always treasure that night since it was so unforgettable.

What do you like or not like about them?,I love staying in hotels. I love the service of requesting for foods and getting to enjoy the pampering that comes with staying in hotels. It is even more so if the hotels have a natural ambience and good lighting. Of course I get to enjoy these when the hotels have good service. Bad services usually spoil the moments. ,121081,940272

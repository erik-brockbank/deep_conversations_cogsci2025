What do you like or not like about them?","response":"I do enjoying hotels, actually! There has only been 2 times when I got the feeling it wasn't a great idea (the worry of bed bugs and other domino-effect concerns..), out of around 10 times/10 hotels/motels in total. It was actually a moment to relax and not have to worry too much about things. It was a break from \"life\" as we know it, which is full of pressure's, stress, tension, un-ease! I like the fact that they usually contribute almost entirely to that \"vacation\" we mentally enter! What I do not like about them is sometimes there's things we see or hear, whether outside our room or entering/exiting, that may make the stay sketchy! Always the cheaper motels/hotels will have something that way (out of so many various things we will see, or sometimes hear..). One thing I did NOT like about them is that when I am in a hotel/motel, I do NOT want to be bothered at all! If I need sheets or towels, I will get them myself! Hard not to appreciate them knocking and checking, however the hotel/motel stays I have taken have ALWAYS been a mental break from life, in so many pretty crappy ways through my own life! Most recently, I have been thinking how great it would be to be able to book a hotel for a few weeks to just get away from our current 'crappy' situation... It is an escape, in my brain, that both my daughter and myself would enjoy right now.. The pro's to hotel stay's have certainly outweighed the cons!! Atleast in my own experience.","rt":438896,"timeElapsed":648037}},{"subjectID":"pjbc7eqc5d","prolificID":"663a8c84b8e7c046d854c8dd","studyID":"678f3deb09bb611973ef0351","sessionID":"679274102848584934d29eb2","DEBUG":0,"trialIdx":9,"trialSubmitTS":1737651900242,"trialType":"scale","trialData":{"scaleID":"51","scaleCategory":"personality","scaleText":"I see myself as someone who...is considerate and kind to almost everyone","scaleTextMin":"Strongly disagree","scaleTextMax":"Strongly agree","comprehensionCheck":0,"comprehensionCheckRequestedResponse":null,"sliderStart":50,"response":65,"rt":12835,"timeElapsed":660875}},{"subjectID":"pjbc7eqc5d","prolificID":"663a8c84b8e7c046d854c8dd","studyID":"678f3deb09bb611973ef0351","sessionID":"679274102848584934d29eb2","DEBUG":0,"trialIdx":10,"trialSubmitTS":1737651907879,"trialType":"scale","trialData":{"scaleID":"24","scaleCategory":"personality","scaleText":"I see myself as someone who...is original, comes up with new ideas","scaleTextMin":"Strongly disagree","scaleTextMax":"Strongly agree","comprehensionCheck":0,"comprehensionCheckRequestedResponse":null,"sliderStart":50,"response":73,"rt":7634,"timeElapsed":668512}},{"subjectID":"pjbc7eqc5d","prolificID":"663a8c84b8e7c046d854c8dd","studyID":"678f3deb09bb611973ef0351","sessionID":"679274102848584934d29eb2","DEBUG":0,"trialIdx":11,"trialSubmitTS":1737651915608,"trialType":"scale","trialData":{"scaleID":"20","scaleCategory":"personality","scaleText":"I see myself as someone who...is talkative","scaleTextMin":"Strongly disagree","scaleTextMax":"Strongly agree","comprehensionCheck":0,"comprehensionCheckRequestedResponse":null,"sliderStart":50,"response":27,"rt":7727,"timeElapsed":676241}},{"subjectID":"pjbc7eqc5d","prolificID":"663a8c84b8e7c046d854c8dd","studyID":"678f3deb09bb611973ef0351","sessionID":"679274102848584934d29eb2","DEBUG":0,"trialIdx":12,"trialSubmitTS":1737651973838,"trialType":"scale","trialData":{"scaleID":"62","scaleCategory":"personality","scaleText":"I see myself as someone who...is easily distracted","scaleTextMin":"Strongly disagree","scaleTextMax":"Strongly agree","comprehensionCheck":0,"comprehensionCheckRequestedResponse":null,"sliderStart":50,"response":76,"rt":58227,"timeElapsed":734471}},{"subjectID":"pjbc7eqc5d","prolificID":"663a8c84b8e7c046d854c8dd","studyID":"678f3deb09bb611973ef0351","sessionID":"679274102848584934d29eb2","DEBUG":0,"trialIdx":13,"trialSubmitTS":1737651978736,"trialType":"scale","trialData":{"scaleID":"39","scaleCategory":"personality","scaleText":"I see myself as someone who...has an active imagination","scaleTextMin":"Strongly disagree","scaleTextMax":"Strongly agree","comprehensionCheck":0,"comprehensionCheckRequestedResponse":null,"sliderStart":50,"response":58,"rt":4895,"timeElapsed":739369}},{"subjectID":"pjbc7eqc5d","prolificID":"663a8c84b8e7c046d854c8dd","studyID":"678f3deb09bb611973ef0351","sessionID":"679274102848584934d29eb2","DEBUG":0,"trialIdx":14,"trialSubmitTS":1737652176981,"trialType":"question","trialData":{"questionID":"164","questionCategory":"small talk","questionText":"What is the last concert or performance you saw?

I thought it was a new experience, one which I needed, to get moving forward in our lives, since we were away from a pretty troublesome environment. I figured that we had the normalcy necessary to live a normal life! It only took a single month to learn that not only was I wrong, but now I am going to carry a heavy burden, AGAIN, and am have to going to try to maintain myself as a model that my daughter needs, knowing damn well nothing at our hands for any relief will favor our situation that will actually omit the details that are flat out wrong from happening anymore! The major turning point is that what little faith I had in the system that is there for THIS has been almost entirely diminished, and I have practically no respect at all for it. It sometimes goes up, sometimes goes down, but ultimately, the turning point is that when, and if, you as a person happen to need help that requires another human being, and if your are not versed in social norms (or are just awkward or whatever...), you will continue to struggle until a burst of luck happens to come your way so that you can dig yourself out of a deep hole that only happened from you working VERY hard in various ways to do what you are supposed to do There's a few turning points here, actually, but the main one is how I am watching our criminal system favor someone taking advantage and that it happens to be the stronger weight, over my daughter being safe and feeling safe in HER home! So, someone who has done this through life repeatedly just doing it against us in our home again, versus the legal system not putting their foot down for a full year to get this house sane! Multiple turning points here, but my view of this system may be the biggest.

absorbed in their own stress or their own baggage and take it out on he who looks at that very friendship and questions these things. I have always had trouble dealing with people, and although respectful, considerate, and distant personally, I have still struggled and never quite fit in and have never really had a friendship that I could have relied on for that (there is 1 guy I have learned is the only human being out of so many \"friends\" I would call that..). I would prefer to just be with my daughter and nobody else.. I no longer seek companionship. I value the privacy and peace I get from sticking to myself when I actually can do that (having a kid means you can not do for yourself, but you do what's best for your kid-I wish I could just stay hidden in my home all the time but I enjoy my kid having a normal life and getting out and doing things.

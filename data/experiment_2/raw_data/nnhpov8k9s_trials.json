I was working as a cashier, and we were all of a sudden required to stand for the whole duration of our shift. We could use a special stool, but it was frowned upon. Because I have back issues, I had to use the stool from time to time. I knew it would likely hurt me, but I didn't it anyway. And hurt me, it did. I was unable to recover from the pain, and it was the final straw, so to speak, that then brought on a neurological disorder in full force.","rt":146707,"timeElapsed":231491}},{"subjectID":"nnhpov8k9s","prolificID":"5dde0d3ce2dcbdd798721c65","studyID":"678f3deb09bb611973ef0351","sessionID":"67927426d6ae38966a263602","DEBUG":0,"trialIdx":2,"trialSubmitTS":1737651490008,"trialType":"scale","trialData":{"scaleID":"6","scaleCategory":"face processing","scaleText":"I see myself as someone who...is dominant","scaleTextMin":"Strongly disagree","scaleTextMax":"Strongly agree","comprehensionCheck":0,"comprehensionCheckRequestedResponse":null,"sliderStart":50,"response":52,"rt":5475,"timeElapsed":236969}},{"subjectID":"nnhpov8k9s","prolificID":"5dde0d3ce2dcbdd798721c65","studyID":"678f3deb09bb611973ef0351","sessionID":"67927426d6ae38966a263602","DEBUG":0,"trialIdx":3,"trialSubmitTS":1737651616022,"trialType":"question","trialData":{"questionID":"41","questionCategory":"personal","questionText":"If you were given the chance to relive any day in your life, do you know which day it would be?

I am coming to the point in my life where I accept everything that has happened - the good, the bad, the painful, the ugly. I am a strong person now, and I am healing from my childhood traumas, some of them extreme. Were it not for so-called regrets, I may not have taken the time and energy to do deep-diving self-reflection. Had I not done that, I wouldn't have come to the emotional, spiritual, and physical healing that I am now undergoing.

am.","rt":126005,"timeElapsed":362982}},{"subjectID":"nnhpov8k9s","prolificID":"5dde0d3ce2dcbdd798721c65","studyID":"678f3deb09bb611973ef0351","sessionID":"67927426d6ae38966a263602","DEBUG":0,"trialIdx":4,"trialSubmitTS":1737651621018,"trialType":"scale","trialData":{"scaleID":"55","scaleCategory":"personality","scaleText":"I

Or, it might be because I'm at my vacation destination, so it's nice to be where I planned on being. I like hotels, too, because they often have a pool, and I love to swim. I also like the continental breakfast, which is a nice perk. The thing I don't like about hotels is that sometimes they're noisy and sometimes they're not very clean.

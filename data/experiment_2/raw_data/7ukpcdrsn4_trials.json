A good joke is not lost on me and I will laugh at the dumbest things.","rt":122018,"timeElapsed":360003}},{"subjectID":"7ukpcdrsn4","prolificID":"664fa6197cd2ac12ab45da27","studyID":"678f3deb09bb611973ef0351","sessionID":"67929461d2b416af67af43a1","DEBUG":0,"trialIdx":38,"trialSubmitTS":1737659863982,"trialType":"scale","trialData":{"scaleID":"40","scaleCategory":"personality","scaleText":"I see myself as someone who...tends to be quiet","scaleTextMin":"Strongly disagree","scaleTextMax":"Strongly agree","comprehensionCheck":0,"comprehensionCheckRequestedResponse":null,"sliderStart":50,"response":18,"rt":2685,"timeElapsed":362688}},{"subjectID":"7ukpcdrsn4","prolificID":"664fa6197cd2ac12ab45da27","studyID":"678f3deb09bb611973ef0351","sessionID":"67929461d2b416af67af43a1","DEBUG":0,"trialIdx":39,"trialSubmitTS":1737659865877,"trialType":"scale","trialData":{"scaleID":"20","scaleCategory":"personality","scaleText":"I see myself as someone who...is talkative","scaleTextMin":"Strongly disagree","scaleTextMax":"Strongly agree","comprehensionCheck":0,"comprehensionCheckRequestedResponse":null,"sliderStart":50,"response":85,"rt":1894,"timeElapsed":364584}},{"subjectID":"7ukpcdrsn4","prolificID":"664fa6197cd2ac12ab45da27","studyID":"678f3deb09bb611973ef0351","sessionID":"67929461d2b416af67af43a1","DEBUG":0,"trialIdx":40,"trialSubmitTS":1737659867934,"trialType":"scale","trialData":{"scaleID":"54","scaleCategory":"personality","scaleText":"I see myself as someone who...prefers work that is routine","scaleTextMin":"Strongly disagree","scaleTextMax":"Strongly agree","comprehensionCheck":0,"comprehensionCheckRequestedResponse":null,"sliderStart":50,"response":76,"rt":2055,"timeElapsed":366640}},{"subjectID":"7ukpcdrsn4","prolificID":"664fa6197cd2ac12ab45da27","studyID":"678f3deb09bb611973ef0351","sessionID":"67929461d2b416af67af43a1","DEBUG":0,"trialIdx":41,"trialSubmitTS":1737659870126,"trialType":"scale","trialData":{"scaleID":"23","scaleCategory":"personality","scaleText":"I see myself as someone who...is depressed, blue","scaleTextMin":"Strongly disagree","scaleTextMax":"Strongly agree","comprehensionCheck":0,"comprehensionCheckRequestedResponse":null,"sliderStart":50,"response":1,"rt":2191,"timeElapsed":368832}},{"subjectID":"7ukpcdrsn4","prolificID":"664fa6197cd2ac12ab45da27","studyID":"678f3deb09bb611973ef0351","sessionID":"67929461d2b416af67af43a1","DEBUG":0,"trialIdx":42,"trialSubmitTS":1737659871990,"trialType":"scale","trialData":{"scaleID":"31","scaleCategory":"personality","scaleText":"I see myself as someone who...starts quarrels with others","scaleTextMin":"Strongly disagree","scaleTextMax":"Strongly agree","comprehensionCheck":0,"comprehensionCheckRequestedResponse":null,"sliderStart":50,"response":41,"rt":1862,"timeElapsed":370696}},{"subjectID":"7ukpcdrsn4","prolificID":"664fa6197cd2ac12ab45da27","studyID":"678f3deb09bb611973ef0351","sessionID":"67929461d2b416af67af43a1","DEBUG":0,"trialIdx":43,"trialSubmitTS":1737659873670,"trialType":"scale","trialData":{"scaleID":"52","scaleCategory":"personality","scaleText":"I see myself as someone who...does things efficiently","scaleTextMin":"Strongly disagree","scaleTextMax":"Strongly agree","comprehensionCheck":0,"comprehensionCheckRequestedResponse":null,"sliderStart":50,"response":85,"rt":1679,"timeElapsed":372376}},{"subjectID":"7ukpcdrsn4","prolificID":"664fa6197cd2ac12ab45da27","studyID":"678f3deb09bb611973ef0351","sessionID":"67929461d2b416af67af43a1","DEBUG":0,"trialIdx":44,"trialSubmitTS":1737659875430,"trialType":"scale","trialData":{"scaleID":"42","scaleCategory":"personality","scaleText":"I see myself as someone who...tends to be lazy","scaleTextMin":"Strongly disagree","scaleTextMax":"Strongly agree","comprehensionCheck":0,"comprehensionCheckRequestedResponse":null,"sliderStart":50,"response":2,"rt":1759,"timeElapsed":374136}},{"subjectID":"7ukpcdrsn4","prolificID":"664fa6197cd2ac12ab45da27","studyID":"678f3deb09bb611973ef0351","sessionID":"67929461d2b416af67af43a1","DEBUG":0,"trialIdx":45,"trialSubmitTS":1737659876990,"trialType":"scale","trialData":{"scaleID":"13","scaleCategory":"face processing","scaleText":"I see myself as someone who...is aggressive","scaleTextMin":"Strongly disagree","scaleTextMax":"Strongly agree","comprehensionCheck":0,"comprehensionCheckRequestedResponse":null,"sliderStart":50,"response":0,"rt":1559,"timeElapsed":375697}},{"subjectID":"7ukpcdrsn4","prolificID":"664fa6197cd2ac12ab45da27","studyID":"678f3deb09bb611973ef0351","sessionID":"67929461d2b416af67af43a1","DEBUG":0,"trialIdx":46,"trialSubmitTS":1737660001792,"trialType":"question","trialData":{"questionID":"234","questionCategory":"small talk","questionText":"Describe the weather where you are currently.

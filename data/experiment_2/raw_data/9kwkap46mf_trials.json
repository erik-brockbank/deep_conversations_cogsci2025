Not lying to get our way or to feel more liked/more comfortable.  Acceptance is a big one too.

oneself.","rt":123855,"timeElapsed":292436}},{"subjectID":"9kwkap46mf","prolificID":"65de2c6358e2556c9250dd6f","studyID":"678f3deb09bb611973ef0351","sessionID":"679273ac22616023007b50ef","DEBUG":0,"trialIdx":21,"trialSubmitTS":1737651427004,"trialType":"scale","trialData":{"scaleID":"44","scaleCategory":"personality","scaleText":"I

I am sure this is already out there, but maybe a combination of coffee, dark chocolate and blueberry.  Those are my favorite non-mint-chip ice cream flavors.  Maybe just try to somehow make an ice cream that overall was as un-sweet as possible.  I love ice cream more for the texture than the sugariness.  So a super creamy, not super sweet ice cream that was maybe a coffee flavor base with dark chocolate chunks and blueberries in it.","rt":123408,"timeElapsed":481108}},{"subjectID":"9kwkap46mf","prolificID":"65de2c6358e2556c9250dd6f","studyID":"678f3deb09bb611973ef0351","sessionID":"679273ac22616023007b50ef","DEBUG":0,"trialIdx":34,"trialSubmitTS":1737651613827,"trialType":"scale","trialData":{"scaleID":"45","scaleCategory":"personality","scaleText":"I see myself as someone who...has an assertive personality","scaleTextMin":"Strongly disagree","scaleTextMax":"Strongly agree","comprehensionCheck":0,"comprehensionCheckRequestedResponse":null,"sliderStart":50,"response":8,"rt":3734,"timeElapsed":484843}},{"subjectID":"9kwkap46mf","prolificID":"65de2c6358e2556c9250dd6f","studyID":"678f3deb09bb611973ef0351","sessionID":"679273ac22616023007b50ef","DEBUG":0,"trialIdx":35,"trialSubmitTS":1737651617043,"trialType":"scale","trialData":{"scaleID":"33","scaleCategory":"personality","scaleText":"I see myself as someone who...can be tense","scaleTextMin":"Strongly disagree","scaleTextMax":"Strongly agree","comprehensionCheck":0,"comprehensionCheckRequestedResponse":null,"sliderStart":50,"response":87,"rt":3215,"timeElapsed":488059}},{"subjectID":"9kwkap46mf","prolificID":"65de2c6358e2556c9250dd6f","studyID":"678f3deb09bb611973ef0351","sessionID":"679273ac22616023007b50ef","DEBUG":0,"trialIdx":36,"trialSubmitTS":1737651620276,"trialType":"scale","trialData":{"scaleID":"19","scaleCategory":"face processing","scaleText":"I see myself as someone who...is responsible","scaleTextMin":"Strongly disagree","scaleTextMax":"Strongly agree","comprehensionCheck":0,"comprehensionCheckRequestedResponse":null,"sliderStart":50,"response":65,"rt":3232,"timeElapsed":491292}},{"subjectID":"9kwkap46mf","prolificID":"65de2c6358e2556c9250dd6f","studyID":"678f3deb09bb611973ef0351","sessionID":"679273ac22616023007b50ef","DEBUG":0,"trialIdx":37,"trialSubmitTS":1737651626516,"trialType":"scale","trialData":{"scaleID":"26","scaleCategory":"personality","scaleText":"I see myself as someone who...is helpful and unselfish with others","scaleTextMin":"Strongly disagree","scaleTextMax":"Strongly agree","comprehensionCheck":0,"comprehensionCheckRequestedResponse":null,"sliderStart":50,"response":66,"rt":6239,"timeElapsed":497532}},{"subjectID":"9kwkap46mf","prolificID":"65de2c6358e2556c9250dd6f","studyID":"678f3deb09bb611973ef0351","sessionID":"679273ac22616023007b50ef","DEBUG":0,"trialIdx":38,"trialSubmitTS":1737651629932,"trialType":"scale","trialData":{"scaleID":"34","scaleCategory":"personality","scaleText":"I see myself as someone who...is ingenious, a deep thinker","scaleTextMin":"Strongly disagree","scaleTextMax":"Strongly agree","comprehensionCheck":0,"comprehensionCheckRequestedResponse":null,"sliderStart":50,"response":26,"rt":3415,"timeElapsed":500948}},{"subjectID":"9kwkap46mf","prolificID":"65de2c6358e2556c9250dd6f","studyID":"678f3deb09bb611973ef0351","sessionID":"679273ac22616023007b50ef","DEBUG":0,"trialIdx":39,"trialSubmitTS":1737651751308,"trialType":"question","trialData":{"questionID":"213","questionCategory":"small talk","questionText":"Do you enjoy staying in hotels?
